The sum is passed through a squashing (aka activation) function and generates an output in [0,1].  This output value (which can be thought of as a probability) is then compared with a threshold (such as 0.5) to produce a binary label (0 or 1).  This technique supports only classification problems with two output classes, hence the name binary LR.  In the binary LR example shown above, the [sigmoid][] function is used as the squashing function.\n",

Each summation node uses its own set of weights to scale the input features and sum them together. Instead of passing the summed output of the weighted input features through a sigmoid squashing function, the output is often passed through a `softmax` function (which in addition to squashing, like the `sigmoid`, the `softmax` normalizes each nodes' output value using the sum of all unnormalized nodes). \n",

This approach is  attractive since it does not require the entire data set (all observation) to be loaded in memory and also requires gradient computation over fewer datapoints, thus allowing for training on large data sets. However, the updates generated using a single observation sample at a time can vary wildly between iterations. An intermediate ground is to use a small set of observations and use an average of the `loss` or error from that set to update the model parameters. This subset is called a *minibatch*.\n",

We repeat the process of model parameters update using different combination of training samples and over a period of time minimize the `loss` (and the error). When the incremental error rates are no longer changing significantly or after a preset number of maximum minibatches to train, we claim that our model is trained.\n",
